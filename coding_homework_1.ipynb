        "**Instructions** (Note: it is very important you follow these instructions in order!)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Run the first *Code Cell* below.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Make a *Markdown Cell* that contains the following information:\n",
        "  * Your name (small header)\n",
        "  * The name of this class (italicized)\n",
        "  * The date (bolded)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Important!**: For each *Code Cell* that you create, make at least one line of code with a `#` in front of it that describes what your code does.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Make a *Code Cell* that turns `v_rest1.csv` into a `Pandas DataFrame` called `pandas_data1`, and `v_rest2.csv` into a `Pandas DataFrame` called `pandas_data2`. Recall that we covered how to import `.csv` files as `Pandas DataFrames` in our in-class coding activity on January 30th. \n",
        "\n",
        "5. Make a *Code Cell* that converts `pandas_data1` into a `list` variable called `data1`, and converts `pandas_data2` into a `list` variable called `data2`. The following syntax is an example of how to do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "data1 = pandas_data1.values.tolist()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. When you convert a `Pandas DataFrame` into a `list`, it brackets each individual element - we don't want that! To get around this issue, make a *Code Cell* that flattens `data1` and `data2` using the `numpy.squeeze()` function. Your first *Code Cell* imported the `NumPy` module as `np`, so we can use the following code to flatten `data1`:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "data1 = np.squeeze(data1)\n",
        "```\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat this for `data2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Make a *Code Cell* that prints the length of `data1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Make a *Code Cell* that prints the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th elements of `data2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Make a *Code Cell* that prints the second-to-last and last elements of `data1` (use negative indexing).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Make a *Code Cell* that prints the `type` of `data2` by using the `type` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. The first *Code Cell* you ran imports a module called `matplotlib`. In a new *Code Cell*, use `matplotlib` to make a histogram of `data1`. You can use the syntax `plt.hist()` to do this (remember that the variable you are applying the function to goes inside of the parentheses). \n",
        "\n",
        "12. In a new *Code Cell*, re-make your histogram and use the `plt.xlabel()` and `plt.ylabel()` functions to label your axes.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. In a new *Code Cell*, follow the instructions in steps 11 and 12 to make another histogram with axis labels for `data2`. \n",
        "\n",
        "14. In a new *Markdown Cell*, write a brief description of any differences that you observe between your two histograms. Does one group of cells seem to have a higher/lower resting membrane potential than the other group of cells?\n",
        "\n",
        "15. In a new *Code Cell*, create a new variable called `data3`. Let `data3` be a list containing both `data1` and `data2`. \n",
        "\n",
        "16. Make a *Code Cell* that prints the last element of `data2`. You must index `data3` to do this (hint: we covered this in our in-class coding activity on February 1st).\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Save a copy of this notebook to your GitHub repo with the title \"coding_homework_1.pynb\". "
